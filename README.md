## Overview

Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by recursively dividing the array into halves until each sub-array contains only one element. Then, it merges the sub-arrays in a sorted manner to produce the final sorted array.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/0kakarot0/MergeSort.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd MergeSort
    ```

## Usage

To run the Merge Sort implementation, you can compile and run the `MergeSort` class.

### Compile:

```sh
javac -d bin src/merge_sort/MergeSort.java
```

Run:
```sh
java -cp bin merge_sort.MergeSort
```
